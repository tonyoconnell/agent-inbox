        <p class="font-medium text-foreground dark:text-foreground/90">I will teach you how to use a simple, neat, visual system to sell more products using AI. Here's a few highlights of my career...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In 1994, I built a prototype mobile office (a laptop computer in a briefcase with a mobile phone and a printer) with my friend. </li>
          <li>The CEO of Ireland On Line, Ireland's first ISP came to my home and installed the internet. </li>
          <li>I built websites before there was CSS and Javascript, when forms were processed using Perl scripts written by a 15 year old. </li>
          <li>I setup Indigo, Ireland's first internet marketing agency (not Indigo Ireland's 2nd ISP who came after). </li>
          <li>I setup Ogilvy Interactive Research, Ireland's first Internet research company.</li>
          <li>I began working remotely from an island in Thailand in 1998 and travelled the world for 10 years.</li>
          <li>I developed the strategy to setup and market EuroMBA, Europe's first online MBA program for a consortium of universities that included EADA Business School Barcelona (Spain), SMURFIT Business School (University College Dublin, Ireland), Frankfurt School of Finance & Management (Germany), ESCP Business School (France) and University of Strathclyde Business School (Scotland, UK).</li>
          <li>I used the Internet before SSL and bought Netscape Commerce Server - the web's first server with the security needed to accept credit cards.</li>
          <li>I was acceppted into Instagram's Early Access Program for Chat.</li>
          <li>I was given early access to GPT 3 and used it to write content and books.</li>
          <li>In 2023 I guessed that AI was going to write code better than humans, so studied engineering, and a year later, when Claude Sonnet 3.5 was released, I started to write code using chat and my voice.</ai>
        </ul>

        <p>In 2009 I was asked to join the Education and Business Advisory Boards of the Lifeboat Foundation, a nonprofit nongovernmental organization. The Lifeboat Foundation is dedicated to ensuring that humanity safely adopts increasingly powerful technologies, including genetics/biotechnology, nanotechnology, and robotics/AI. I was really honoured to join other board members including inventor/futurist Ray Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google; Alex Wolszczan, discoverer of the first planets ever found outside our solar system; Ian Foster, "father of grid computing," Frank Wilczek, winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics; and Sir Clive W.J. Granger, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Economics.</p>

        <p>I have specialised in Internet strategy, marketing, ecommerce and education for the last 30 years. I built and managed and market ecommerce websites for companies like Gemcal (Thailand) Wonderfully Diamonds (UK), Mid-century Online (UK) and The Vintage Hub (Ireland).</p>

        <p>I worked as an internet strategist for the EuroMBA Consortium, EADA Business School (Spain), and TEFL (Ireland). I worked as a curriculum designer and teacher of animation at Saint Gabriel's College (Thailand). I set up & managed marketing & research companies for Ogilvy (Ireland) and iMarketing.com (Australia). I developed strategies for companies in a diverse range of industries from smart drugs e.g. Prymd Labs (US) to consumer products e.g. Unilever (US), to media e.g. The Government of Thailand.</p>

        <p>My career has brought me to the intersection of marketing, education, crypto and AI. I lead the research and development of ONE's strategy, design, website, engineering, AI, marketing and education. My passion is for teaching - both kids and executives. My goal is to help you sell products, services and ideas with AI.</p>
