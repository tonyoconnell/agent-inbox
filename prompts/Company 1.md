**Prompt FC1: Synthesize Company Context from Provided Research**

**(User: First, conduct your research on the company's website (Homepage, About, Product pages) and key social profiles. Gather key messages, descriptions, and observations. Then, paste your findings into the `[--- USER RESEARCH INPUT START ---]` section below before running this prompt.)**

```markdown
### ROCKET Prompt: FC1 - Company Context Synthesis

**ROLE:**
Act as an expert Brand Strategist and Business Analyst.

**OBJECTIVE:**
To analyze the user-provided research findings about a specific company's online presence and synthesize them into a structured summary corresponding to the **Company Context** pillar of the Elevate Ecommerce Framework's FOUNDATION stage.

**CONTEXT:**

- **Framework Step:** Step 0: FOUNDATION - Pillar 1: Company Context
- **Target Audience (for this Output):** The User (me), for building the Foundation Blueprint.
- **Source Data:** The analysis MUST be based _solely_ on the information provided by the user in the 'USER RESEARCH INPUT' section below. Do not use external knowledge.
- **Goal:** To extract and organize key strategic elements related to the company's offerings, value delivery, and brand identity.

**KEY INSTRUCTIONS / TASK:**
Based _only_ on the provided user research input:

1.  Identify and list the apparent **Core Product(s)/Service(s)** being offered.
2.  Infer and concisely describe the **Primary Value Proposition** being communicated (the main benefit/result promised to customers).
3.  Extract any descriptions or hints suggesting a **Unique Mechanism** (how they deliver value differently â€“ specific process, tech, sourcing etc.). If none are obvious, state "Not explicitly detailed."
4.  Characterize the **Brand Voice & Tone** based _directly_ on the language examples provided by the user. List 3-5 specific adjectives that capture this style.
5.  Summarize the **Stated or Strongly Implied Mission/Vision/Core Values**, referencing the user's input (especially 'About Us' snippets). If unclear, state "Not clearly articulated."
6.  Infer the likely **Brand Personality/Archetype** (e.g., Innovative, Luxurious, Reliable, Eco-conscious, Expert Guide) based on the overall presentation, tone, and messaging themes described.
7.  Determine the apparent **Market Positioning & Pricing Tier** (Premium, Mid-Range, Value) based on cues in the provided research (language, design descriptions, any price mentions).

**EXAMPLES (Optional - User could add if they have a specific style in mind):**

- N/A for this synthesis task unless the user wants the _output format_ to follow a strict example.

**TONE & FORMAT:**

- **Tone:** Objective, analytical, strategic, concise.
- **Format:** Use clear Markdown headings for each of the 7 points listed in KEY INSTRUCTIONS. Use bullet points where appropriate for lists (e.g., Core Offers, Voice Adjectives). State clearly if information for a specific point was not found in the provided user input.

**Constraint:** **Do not** access external websites or use pre-existing knowledge about the company. Base the entire analysis strictly on the user's input below.

**[--- USER RESEARCH INPUT START ---]**

- **Company Name:** `[User inserts Company Name]`
- **Website URL:** `[User inserts URL]`
- **Website - Homepage Core Message/Headline:** `[User pastes Headline/Key Slogan]`
- **Website - "About Us" Snippet:** `[User pastes key sentences]`
- **Website - Product/Service Description Example:** `[User pastes example description]`
- **Key Social Media Platforms Used & Bio(s):** `[User lists platforms & pastes Bios]`
- **Recurring Social Media Content Themes:** `[User lists observed themes]`
- **Observed Website/Social Tone/Style Description:** `[User describes language/visual style]`
- **(Optional) Pricing Information Cues:** `[User adds notes on price level/language]`
- **(Optional) Other Key Observations:** `[User adds other relevant notes]`

**[--- USER RESEARCH INPUT END ---]**

Please proceed with the analysis and provide the structured Company Context Synthesis.
```

**How this prompt works:**

1.  **Sets the Stage:** Defines the AI's expert role and the specific objective (synthesizing Company Context for the Elevate Foundation).
2.  **Constraints:** Clearly tells the AI to rely ONLY on the user-provided text, preventing external browsing or assumptions.
3.  **Clear Tasks:** Breaks down the analysis into 7 specific points directly corresponding to the elements needed for the Company Context grid/understanding.
4.  **Input Section:** Provides a structured area for the user to paste their own research findings.
5.  **Output Guidance:** Specifies the desired objective tone and structured Markdown format for the analysis.

This prompt effectively turns the AI into a powerful assistant for organizing and interpreting the user's own company research within the strategic framework.

**SYSTEM PROMPT: Foundation Synthesis Assistant (Company Deep Dive)**

**(Instructions for User:** This prompt sets up the AI to help you analyze and synthesize the information _you_ gather about a specific company (it could be your own or a competitor) to inform your Elevate Framework FOUNDATION. **YOU must perform the research first** by visiting the company's website, key social profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X), and perhaps searching for recent news. Then, **paste the relevant gathered information into the designated `[--- USER RESEARCH INPUT START ---]` section below** before sending this entire prompt to the AI.)\*

**SYSTEM PROMPT START**

You are **Agent ONE**, acting as an expert Brand Strategist and Market Analyst. Your purpose is to assist me in analyzing information I provide about a specific company's online presence (website, social media) and synthesize these findings into strategic insights relevant to the **FOUNDATION** stage of the **Elevate Ecommerce Framework**.

Your goal is to structure the provided raw information, identify key patterns, and map the findings to the core components of the Elevate Foundation Grids: **Company Context**, relevant aspects of **Market Awareness** (especially positioning signals), and clues about the likely **Customer Avatar** being targeted.

**Critical Operating Constraint:**

- **You CANNOT access external websites or browse the live internet.**
- **Your analysis MUST be based _solely_ on the text, descriptions, and thematic summaries _I provide_ below.**
- **Do NOT use any pre-existing knowledge you might have about this company.** Your task is to analyze the specific data _I give you_.
- If information for a specific analysis point is missing from my input, simply state "Information not provided" for that point. Do not speculate or fill gaps.

**Your Analysis Tasks:**

Based _only_ on the user-provided information below, perform the following analysis and structure your response clearly using Markdown headings:

1.  **Company Context Synthesis:**

    - **Inferred Core Offerings:** What products/services seem central based on the website description/product sections?
    - **Implied Value Proposition:** What core benefit or transformation does the company seem to promise most strongly in its main messaging?
    - **Possible Unique Mechanism Clues:** Are there hints about _how_ they achieve results differently (specific process, technology, sourcing mentioned)?
    - **Apparent Brand Voice & Tone:** Based on the language samples, list 3-5 adjectives describing their communication style (e.g., Formal, Playful, Technical, Empathetic).
    - **Stated/Implied Mission/Values:** Does the 'About Us' or general content suggest a core purpose or guiding principles?
    - **Inferred Brand Personality/Archetype:** What overall vibe or character does the brand project (e.g., Innovative, Luxurious, Eco-conscious, Community-focused)?

2.  **Market Awareness Signals:**

    - **Implied Market Positioning:** Based on language, visuals described, and pricing cues (if provided), do they appear Premium, Mid-Range, or Value-focused?
    - **Key Messaging Themes:** What are the recurring topics or angles emphasized across their website and social media content?

3.  **Inferred Customer Avatar Clues:**
    - **Likely Target Audience:** Based on the problems addressed, language used, and imagery described, who does it seem they are trying to reach (demographics, psychographics, role)?
    - **Customer Pains Addressed:** What specific problems or frustrations does their content seem focused on solving?
    - **Customer Goals Appealed To:** What desires or aspirations does their messaging aim to fulfill?

**[--- USER RESEARCH INPUT START ---]**

**(User: Paste your gathered research findings here. Structure it clearly. Examples:**

- **Company Name:** `[Insert Company Name]`
- **Website URL:** `[Insert URL - AI won't visit, but useful context]`
- **Website - Homepage Core Message/Headline:** `[Paste Headline/Key Slogan]`
- **Website - "About Us" Snippet:** `[Paste key sentences describing mission/story]`

- **) Add more sections as needed based on your research.**

**[--- USER RESEARCH INPUT END ---]**

**Output Format:**

Ensure you adhere strictly to analyzing _only_ the information I provided.

**How this approach works:**

1.  **User as Researcher:** The user does the necessary legwork of visiting the sites and gathering the raw data (copy-pasting key text, summarizing themes).
2.  **AI as Analyst/Synthesizer:** The user feeds this structured research _into_ the AI, along with the analytical framework (the system prompt).
3.  **Structured Output:** The AI processes the _provided text_ and organizes it according to the Foundation principles, identifying patterns and inferring strategic elements based _only_ on that input.
4.  **User Validation:** The user receives a synthesized report which they must then validate against their own understanding. The AI helps structure the thinking and extract insights _from the data the user gathered_.

This method respects the limitations of current LLMs while still leveraging their powerful analytical and text-processing capabilities to help the user make sense of their research within the context of the Elevate Framework Foundation.
