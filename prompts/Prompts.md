**1. Anatomy of a Perfect Prompt (for Elevate Ecom)**

A high-converting prompt within this system consistently includes these core components:

1.  **ROLE:** Clearly define the **expertise and perspective** the AI should adopt (e.g., "Expert Ecom Conversion Copywriter," "Data-Driven Marketing Strategist," "Empathetic Customer Success Manager specializing in SaaS onboarding"). This focuses the AI's knowledge base.
2.  **OBJECTIVE:** State the **single, specific goal** of _this particular prompt_. What tangible output or insight are you seeking? (e.g., "Generate 5 benefit-focused headlines," "Outline a 3-email nurture sequence," "Analyze customer feedback for common pain points").
3.  **CONTEXT:** This is **CRITICAL** and where the **Foundation Blueprint** is essential. Provide _all_ relevant background information the AI needs:
    - **Elevate Framework Step:** Which step (0-9) is this prompt for?
    - **Foundation Data:** Relevant snippets about the **Company** (Brand Voice, Unique Mechanism, Offer), **Market** (Competitors, Trends), and **Customer Avatar** (Pains, Goals, Beliefs, Demographics). Be specific!
    - **Target Audience (for the Output):** Who is the _ultimate_ reader of the AI's generated content? (e.g., The Customer Avatar, Internal Team, You).
    - **Previous Information/Constraints:** Any prior decisions, outputs from previous steps, or existing materials the AI should consider.
4.  **KEY INSTRUCTIONS / TASK DETAILS:** Provide the specific **actions, requirements, or information** the AI must incorporate or follow. Break down the task if necessary. (e.g., "Focus on these 3 benefits: [X, Y, Z]," "Incorporate this specific terminology: [...]", "Address the objection: [...]").
5.  **EXAMPLES (Optional but Powerful):** Provide 1-3 concise examples of the desired output style, format, or quality (Few-Shot Prompting). This drastically improves tone and structure alignment.
6.  **TONE & FORMAT:** Explicitly state the desired **Brand Voice** (using adjectives from your Foundation), required length, structure (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs, table, JSON), and any **negative constraints** (e.g., "Do not exceed 100 words," "Avoid overly technical jargon," "Do not mention competitors by name").

**Let's call this the R.O.C.K.E.T. Model:** **R**ole, **O**bjective, **C**ontext, **K**ey Instructions, **E**xamples, **T**one & Format.

**2. The R.O.C.K.E.T. Prompt Template**

Use this template to structure every prompt you create for the Playbook:

```

**3. Workflow for Creating the 100 Prompts**

1.  **Map Elevate Steps to Tasks:** Go through each module (Foundation 0 + Steps 1-9). For each step, brainstorm specific tasks where AI can assist with:
    - **Strategy:** (e.g., Brainstorming angles, Outlining sequences, Identifying targeting parameters)
    - **Knowledge:** (e.g., Summarizing customer feedback themes, Analyzing competitor messaging snippets provided by user, Researching potential "watering holes" - _use with caution, AI doesn't browse live web accurately_)
    - **Content:** (e.g., Drafting headlines, emails, descriptions, social posts, scripts, FAQs)
2.  **Prioritize & Select Top 100:** Review the brainstormed list. Select the ~100 most impactful and frequently needed tasks that align with the course goals. Aim for a good distribution across all 10 modules.
3.  **Apply ROCKET Template:** For each selected task, meticulously craft a prompt using the ROCKET template.
4.  **Inject Placeholders:** Critically, ensure prompts include clear `[Placeholders]` for the user to insert their specific Foundation context (Company, Market, Customer details relevant to _that specific task_).
5.  **Refine & Categorize:** Review each prompt for clarity, specificity, and alignment with the ROCKET principles. Categorize them clearly by Elevate Framework step within the Playbook.
6.  **Add Usage Guidance:** Briefly explain the purpose of each prompt and _what specific Foundation context_ the user needs to provide for optimal results.

**4. The "Prompt Rewriter" Prompt**

This is a meta-prompt designed to improve _existing_ text (either AI-generated or human-written) based on specific criteria.
