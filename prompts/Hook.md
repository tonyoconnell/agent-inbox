**PART 2: DEEP RESEARCH & STRATEGIC ANALYSIS (AI TASK)**

Leverage your Deep Research capabilities and strategic analysis based _only_ on the FOUNDATION provided above to perform the following:

1.  **Validate/Refine FIND Channel Focus:** Briefly analyze (using web search if needed to assess general channel viability/audience fit for the niche) the user-prioritized channels (`[Prioritized FIND Channels]`). Are they optimally suited for reaching the described Customer Avatar with their likely awareness stage(s)? Suggest potential refinements or confirmations based on public data/common sense for this niche/avatar type.
2.  **Identify Primary HOOK Angle Opportunities:** Based on the _entire_ Foundation Blueprint (esp. deepest Pains/Fears vs. highest Goals/Dreams vs. strongest Differentiation vs. Market Trends), recommend the **Top 2-3 strategic HOOK angles** (e.g., Agitate Core Pain X, Promise Attainment of Dream Y, Challenge Common Market Belief Z via Unique Mechanism) most likely to resonate powerfully with this specific Avatar on the prioritized channels. Justify each recommendation briefly.
3.  **Deep Dive Competitor HOOK Analysis (Optional but Recommended):** If competitor URLs were provided, _briefly_ browse their homepage/key product pages. Identify their primary visible HOOKS/headlines. How do they compare to your recommended strategic angles? Where are the openings for _your_ hooks to stand out? _(State if competitor URLs not provided)._
4.  **Tailor Message Strategy per Channel & Awareness:** For _each_ prioritized channel and the corresponding likely Awareness Stage(s) of the Avatar _on that channel_, briefly outline the most effective HOOK _type_ (e.g., Facebook - high emotion Pain hook; Google Search - direct Benefit/Solution hook matching intent; LinkedIn Article - Insight/Intrigue hook challenging status quo).

**PART 3: AI-ACCELERATED ASSET GENERATION (AI TASK)**

Now, generate the following initial HOOK assets, ensuring strict adherence to the specified **Brand Voice** (`[Brand Voice Adjectives]`) and using the insights from your analysis in Part 2. Ensure hooks connect logically towards the **Proposed GIFT Concept**.

1.  **Primary Channel 1: `[User Specifies Channel 1, e.g., Facebook Ads]`**
    - Generate 3 x **Headline Options** based on Recommended Angle #1 from Part 2 Analysis.
    - Generate 2 x **Headline Options** based on Recommended Angle #2 from Part 2 Analysis.
    - Generate 3 x **Opening Line Options** (First ~1-2 sentences of ad body copy) designed to follow the above headlines and grab attention.
2.  **Primary Channel 2: `[User Specifies Channel 2, e.g., Google Search Ads]`**
    - Generate 3 x **Headline 1 Options** directly targeting likely search intent related to Customer Pains/Goals (use keywords implicitly).
    - Generate 3 x **Headline 2 Options** emphasizing the Unique Mechanism or Value Proposition.
    - Generate 2 x **Description Line 1 Options** (concise, benefit-focused).
3.  **Primary Channel 3 (If applicable): `[User Specifies Channel 3, e.g., Blog Post/SEO]`**
    - Generate 3 x **Compelling Title Options** incorporating relevant keywords and a chosen HOOK angle.
    - Generate 2 x **Meta Description Drafts** that hook interest and align with the title.
    - Generate 1 x **Opening Paragraph Draft** (~50-75 words) that expands on the title hook and draws the reader in.
4.  **(Optional) Generic Social Media Post Hook Snippet:**
    - Generate 2 x intriguing opening sentences suitable for an organic social post (e.g., LinkedIn or Instagram feed) using a primary Hook angle.

**PART 4: STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS & NEXT STEPS (AI TASK)**

Provide concise recommendations based on your analysis:

1.  **Testing Priority:** Which generated hooks seem strongest or most worth A/B testing first based on Foundation alignment and channel context?
2.  **HOOK-to-GIFT Linkage:** Briefly confirm how the generated hook angles naturally create interest or need for the specified **Proposed GIFT Concept**.
3.  **Key Considerations:** Any immediate flags or critical points the user should remember when refining these drafts and implementing the HOOK strategy?

**Output Format:**
Present the response clearly structured using Markdown:

- Use headings for Part 2 (Analysis), Part 3 (Assets), and Part 4 (Recommendations).
- Use sub-headings within Part 3 for each channel.
- Use numbered or bulleted lists for generated assets and recommendations.
- Ensure all generated creative assets _strictly reflect_ the user-provided Brand Voice.

**Execute Deep Research and Synthesis now.** Show your reasoning where applicable during the analysis phase. Focus on providing _profound strategic insight_ combined with _immediately actionable creative drafts_. The goal is to delight the CEO with both strategic depth and executional speed.
