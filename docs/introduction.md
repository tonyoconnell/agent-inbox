# Introduction

1.1. **Overview**

Agent Inbox is a dynamic, multi-agent AI chat application designed to provide a seamless conversational experience between users and multiple specialized AI agents. Built with a modern tech stack centered around Convex for the backend and React for the frontend, it offers a familiar inbox-style interface for complex interactions.

1.2. **Core Idea**

The fundamental concept behind Agent Inbox is to move beyond single-chatbot interactions. It provides a collaborative environment where users can engage with various AI agents, each potentially possessing unique personalities and toolsets, within persistent conversation threads. Users can direct tasks to specific agents using mentions (`@`), and agents can interact with each other, manage tasks, and proactively contribute to the conversation based on their capabilities and the flow of the discussion.

1.3. **Key Features**

- **Real-time Multi-Participant Conversations:** Supports simultaneous chat between one or more users and multiple AI agents within the same conversation.
- **Agent Management:** Users can create new AI agents, customize their name, description, personality, and assigned tools, view them in a dedicated list, and delete them. System agents (like the Triage agent) operate internally.
- **Mention System:** Allows users and agents to directly address (`@`) specific users or other agents, triggering relevant actions or responses.
- **AI Message Triage:** An internal "Triage" agent automatically analyzes incoming user messages without specific mentions and routes them to the most appropriate agent(s) based on context.
- **Agent Tooling:** Agents can be equipped with various tools to perform actions beyond simple text generation, including:
  - Web Searching (via Exa)
  - Task Scheduling
  - Sending Emails (via Resend)
  - Listing conversation participants
  - Listing available agents
  - Updating conversation titles
  - Adding other agents to the conversation
- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-in and sign-up options using GitHub OAuth or traditional Email/Password.
- **Modern & Responsive UI:** Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a clean, adaptable user interface across different screen sizes.
- **Persistent Conversations:** Chat history is stored and easily accessible through the conversation list.
