# Schema Migration Task System

This section provides a full-featured, collaborative task system for safely migrating to the new schema while keeping the app fully functional. Use this as your live migration board.

## How to Use This Task System
- Each task has a description, owner, priority, dependencies, and status.
- Use checkboxes to track progress: [ ] = not started, [/] = in progress, [x] = done.
- Assign owners and update status as you work.
- Add new tasks using the template below.
- Reference the detailed roadmap and schema.md for context.

### Task Template
| Task Description | Owner | Priority | Dependencies | Status |
|------------------|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
|                  |       |          |              | [ ]    |
