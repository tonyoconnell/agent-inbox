- **Extensibility:** All tables support `meta` fields for future-proofing and custom data.
- **Permission-aware:** Explicit, flexible permissions and sharing‚Äîprivate by default, with public/share controls.
- **Agent/Team Orchestration:** Agents, teams, and workflows are first-class, supporting collaborative, intelligent action.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture-to-Schema Mapping

Every part of the ONE system is powered by the unified schema, ensuring robust, extensible, and permission-aware collaboration between humans and AI agents. Here's how each architecture component maps to the schema:

| Architecture Component         | Mapped Schema Entities                                      | How It Works in the New System                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-Tenancy**             | organisation, environment                                   | Every record is scoped to an organisation; environments separate dev/prod/test for each org.                    |
| **Authentication & Onboarding**| subscriber, onboardingFlow, agent, permission               | Users sign up as subscribers; onboardingFlow tracks their journey; Director/Assistant agents guide onboarding.   |
| **Conversations & Channels**  | channel, conversation, message, group, subscriber           | Conversations are channels; messages are linked to channels; groups manage participants and permissions.         |
| **Agents & Teams**            | agent, group, assignment, tool, knowledge                   | Agents are first-class entities; teams are groups of agents/humans; assignments link agents to tasks/flows.      |
| **@Mentions & Invites**       | subscriber, agent, group, permission                        | Mentions reference users/agents/groups; permissions and invites are managed via schema relationships.            |
| **Agent Orchestration**       | agent, workflow, assignment, progress                       | Director and personal agents orchestrate workflows, assign tasks, and track progress using these tables.         |
| **Tools & Integrations**      | tool, integration, agent                                    | Tools are capabilities assigned to agents; integrations connect to external services (email, web, storage, etc). |
| **Knowledge & RAG**           | knowledge, agent, subscriber                                | Knowledge bases are linked to agents/users for retrieval-augmented generation and search.                        |
| **Permissions & Sharing**     | permission, group, agent, subscriber                        | All resources are private by default; permissions table manages sharing/public access at a granular level.        |
| **Analytics & Progress**      | analytics, progress, job, executionDetail                   | All actions, assignments, and outcomes are tracked for analytics and progress dashboards.                        |
| **Extensibility**             | meta fields on all tables                                   | All entities can be extended with custom data for future-proofing and integrations.                              |

See [schema.md](./docs/schema.md) for full details on each entity and field.

## ü§ñ How It Works
- **Onboarding:** New users are greeted by Director and their personal AI assistant. Director explains the team and offers to create your assistant.
- **Conversations:** Start a chat, @mention anyone, and collaborate in real time. Add external users by email/phone.
- **Agents & Teams:** Create agents with unique personalities, tools, and knowledge. Form groups for projects, customers, or staff.
- **Tasks & Collaboration:** Assign tasks to agents/teams. Track progress and outcomes. Agents can go off and complete tasks, then report back.
- **Tools & Knowledge:** Give agents access to web, messaging, email, calendar, and connect knowledge sources.
- **Permission-Aware:** All resources are private by default. Share with individuals, groups, or make public as needed.
- **Analytics:** Dashboards show agent/team impact, progress, and business results.
